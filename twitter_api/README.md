# Twitter API

The following are various programs to interact with the Twitter API via Python.

1. **getUserInformation:** Get user information based on user id

2. **getting_likes_for_csv:** Takes a already existing csv in that has to contain at least tweet_id and adds likes and retweets to it

3. **Response_Retriver_Brexit:** This code searches for terms related to Brexit (you can just change the searchwords for other topics) it further searches for all responses that the original tweets received.

4. **Universal_Downloader:** This code takes in existing user_ids and searches for their timeline and other information

5. **json_to_jsonl_binder:** This code takes individual json file containing for example a tweet or user information and creates one large jsonl file.

5. **json_remover:** This code deletes all jsons in a directory, which can be useful if this directory has a large number of files, because cmd cannot remove them anymore.

6. **Location_Classifier:** This code categorieses twitter users into either USA, UK or undefined based on their self described location on their twitter profile.
