# Image Manipulation

1.	Make a backup folder – in case you mess up you don’t want to restore everything from scratch
2.	Open `picture_format.ipynb`. There you will see a step by step breakdown
3.	Loop 1 renames all files
4.  Intermittent cell allows you to preview your cropped image to only include the face of the morph
5.	Loop 2 crops all files
6.	Loop 3 reformats all files – make sure “quality” is set to 100 in the file.save() line, otherwise you will end up with low-qual images.
