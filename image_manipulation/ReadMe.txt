Picture Formatter.py

This code transforms the original morphs that you get from fantamorph into the right SIZE, LABEL, and BACKGROUND
In case that some pictures are to bright change the variables such as sensitiyity in the function background_color_changer
Mind that the input picture size has to be around 500 * 650
otherwise you have to adjust the x, y, w, h = 140, 100, 200, 550 values in background_color_changer
I will change that requirement at some point :D
