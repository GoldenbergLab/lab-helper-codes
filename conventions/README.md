# Conventions

Conventions are helpful tools for teams to write code together. There are
many types of conventions that our lab strives to adhere to, such as _naming conventions_
or _data management conventions_.

NOTE: Document in progress. Please add comments or [make a feature request](https://github.com/GoldenbergLab/lab_helper_codes/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=) for things you 
would like to see here. Make sure you reference this file by URL in the
issue if you are hoping for this file to be modified.

The **easiest conventions** are naming conventions. We agree to a pattern of naming
for any given topic of work we do because consistent, predictable names help us find
what we're looking for. Named entities that we share are everywhere: Slack channels, GitHub repositories,
Amazon S3 bucket names, RMarkdown file names, and so many more.

# Tool Conventions

## Slack

### Channel Names

Our lab's Slack channels represent virtual rooms in which we can collaborate
on various topics. Our channel names should:

#### Use all lowercase letters.

- :white_check_mark: `code` or `language-analysis`
- :no_entry_sign: `Code` or `Language-Analysis`

#### Use hyphenated spaces.

- :white_check_mark: `language-analysis`
- :no_entry_sign: `language_analysis`

#### Use descriptive phrases.

- :white_check_mark: `reinforcement-learning`
- :no_entry_sign: `rl`

#### Use the minimum necessary words.

- :white_check_mark: `papers`
- :no_entry_sign: `papers-we-recommend`

#### Use category prefixes for nested channel naming.

Nested channel naming is useful for designating teams to work on a specific
project or stage of project that has sibling channels, such as two different studies,
which are category `studies`, or five different analysis-focused channels, which are
`analysis`-categorized.

- :white_check_mark: `studies_twitter-survey` or `analysis_emotion-amplification`
- :no_entry_sign: `papers-we-recommend`


## GitHub

### Repository Names

Our lab's GitHub organization hosts many repositories that we use to collaborate. Each
repository name should represent the most general possible topic description for that
project. Our repository names should:

#### Use all lowercase letters.

- :white_check_mark: `my-new-repository`
- :no_entry_sign: `My-New-Repository`

#### Use hyphenated spaces.

- :white_check_mark: `twitter-survey-client`
- :no_entry_sign: `twitter_survey_client` or `twitterSurveyClient`

#### Use versionless phrases.

If you find yourself wanting to version your repository name, you
probably are interested in [releasing tagged versions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository)
of the project instead.

- :white_check_mark: `amplification`
- :no_entry_sign: `amplification-10-02` or `amplification-v1`

### Branch Names

Within a repository, you will have a minimum of one _default_ branch. A default
branch should be considered the _most stable_ branch, meaning the least likely to
contain bugs, errors, badly-written code, etc. In GitHub, the `main` branch is
the default branch (or `master` if created prior to late 2020; update the default
to `main` if so, [see why here](https://github.com/github/renaming)).

# Code Conventions

## JavaScript

Anytime you use JavaScript, you should follow tried and true code style guidelines,
and especially so when that code is shared. While we will adopt a set of lab-specific
conventions for writing JavaScript over time, arguably the best style guide is the
[Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/).
