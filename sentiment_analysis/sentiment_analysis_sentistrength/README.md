## Sentiment analysis instructions

This sentiment analysis code is designed to conduct sentiment analysis to a series of texts in a txt file. 
The input file is currently allText.txt. It has a new text in each line. 

To run the code use the **Jupyter notebook** file ClassifyCommentSentiment.ipynb.

In the same folder you should also have:

1. **SentiStrength.jar** which is the java code.
2. The folder **SentiStrength_Data** which contains the dictionaries. 
3. **sentiment_rater_new.py** which has the code that communicates with the the java code.

Ones all three stages have been implemented, follow the instructions on jupyeter notebook.
