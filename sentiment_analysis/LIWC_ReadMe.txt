LIWC PYTHON

In order to be able to use Liwc you have to do the following steps.
Additional information can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/liwc/ and especially https://github.com/chbrown/liwc-python/issues/3

1.) Purchase LIWC
2.) For LIWC 2015, the dictionary in the following .jar file in LIWC installation folder (e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\LIWC2015): \app\lib\LIWC2015-app-1.4.0.jar.
You can open the jar file using WinRAR as an archive and find LIWC2015_English_Flat.dic in com/liwc/LIWC2015/data/dict/. (more Info: https://github.com/chbrown/liwc-python/issues/5)
3.) Extract the LIWC2015_English_Flat.dic using WinRar (THIS FILE IS STILL ENCRYPTED)
4.) Use the script "encrypting_liwc_dic" change in and output locations and .jar location to your directories
5.) Use the unencrypted file like in the example I uploaded (Liwc_analysis.py)
